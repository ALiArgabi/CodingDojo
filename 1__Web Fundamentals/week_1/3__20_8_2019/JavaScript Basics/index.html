            <br>
            <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. IavaScript is
                extremely popular for a variety of reasons. It is a small and
                lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a
                bunch of different directions. JavaScript lives inside a host
                environment (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of
                these environments to provide programmatic control over
                them. </p><br>
            <ul>
                <li><a href=" "><span class="hilighter">Variable Declaration</span></a> JavaScript variables are
                    containers for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee,
                    a variable holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These
                    unique names are called identifiers. <span class="Command">var x;</span>
                </li>

                <li>
                        <a href=" "><span class="hilighter">Variable Assignment</span></a> Assignment operators assign values to IavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our 
                        variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable. <span class="Command">var x = 10;</span>
                     
                </li>
                <li><a href=" "><span class="hilighter">Data Types</span></a> Data types are an important concept to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type. There are six data types 
                    that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean - true or false; null - null aka nothing; Number - 42 or 3.14159; Sting - "Coding Dojo Rocks!" ;
                Array - [1, 'Coding', 2, 'Dojo']; and Object - {first_nameâ€¢ lane', last_name: 'Doe'}
                </li>
                <li><a href=" "><span class="hilighter">Conditionals</span></a> When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions - hitting different code blocks based on 
                    values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. There are the following
                conditional statements: <span class="Command">if</span> a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block; <span class="Command">else</span> if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false; <span class="Command">else</span> we execute this block of code;
                </li>
                <li><a href=" "><span class="hilighter">Loops</span></a> There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat 
                    an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop. Thats a loop!
                </li>
                <li><a href=" "><span class="hilighter">Function</span></a> Functions are an encapsulation of a code block. When we call our function this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of 
                    instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started, first we
                screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our function over and over and over again.
